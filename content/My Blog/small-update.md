Finally got round to fixing an issue where a 404 was being recorded as error.  Should save some disk space :)  I've also added a new friend link for Greg and Jen who are off traveling round the world.

Hopefully this will inspire me to get my ass in gear and do a bit more work on my blog and maybe even write some blog posts! One thing I really want to do is update the design and javascript so when I post code it fits on the page and is syntax highlighted automatically.
