I think I've been to [BadgerBadgerBadger](http://www.badgerbadgerbadger.com/) more times than I've written blog posts. I keep thinking something I've done would be interesting to blog about but when it comes down to it I can never think of what to write.

For now though, I've just converted my blog over to Umbraco, only took me a couple of evenings. I'm hoping the nicer backend than my custom site with it's out the box asp.net styles will encourage me to write more.

I will have a few things to blog about in the near future too. I am currently building a remote control rover robot based on a QWERK control board.  I've hit a bit of a snag trying to step down my 7.5v battery to 3v for the motors but hopefully I'll get that sussed out soon then I can crack on and focus on the wireless part of the project.
