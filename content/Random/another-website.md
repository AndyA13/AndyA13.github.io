I don't know whats happened to me lately but I'm finding web development a bit monotonous.

You finish one site just to start another, it's a pretty boring loop that just gets worse the better you get (the 

faster you build a site, the faster you start the next one).

On the plus side I did get to create a parameter this week called ``noodlyAppendage``, [which was nice][1].
