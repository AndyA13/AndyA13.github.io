There is still a lot to do but I have finally gotten a working version of my blog online. I chose to write my own blog for a chance to play with asp.net MVC 3 and the Razor view engine. So far I really like the Razor view engine and think my HTML looks much cleaner when working with it.  Here is a list of what I hope to update over time:

- Add a search feature
- Have a correctly formatted date when viewing old posts
- Implement MetaWeblog API
- Comments support
- Contact page
- Detect tweets not loading and add redundency
- Add a custom error page
- Make sure all the HTML and CSS is valid
- Minify and combine the js files
- A few styling tweaks

Maybe add a style for lists too.

I did manage to implement an RSS feed and tags which I had missed or not wanted in my original specification.

I would like to thank [Steven Gibson](http://glasgowtozocalo.blogspot.com/) ([@glasgowtozocalo](https://twitter.com/sgxbsxn)) for doing the design for me. It's got the clean, easy to read look I wanted and I'm really happy with it.
