I've found quite a lot of programmers who have taken a keen interest in photography. Me included. I've been interested in photography ever since I found my Dad's old Praktica SLR. I was quite young at the time, I could see moving the dials caused the shutter to stay open for longer but I didn't understand how that affected the exposure.

It was almost 20 years later when a friend at work brought in his DSLR. That sparked the interest again and I finally got my own DSLR, a Canon 500D.  I played around with it for a while before deciding I really needed to understand all the settings to get the most from it.  I'm not sure how these are connected, but I eventually decided to get a film SLR and take a course on developing film at a local gallery called [Street Level Photo works][1].

The Pentax MX is a completely manual camera, no Auto mode here. There is a built in light meter to help get your exposure right, but it's up to you to change the shutter speed and aperture (ISO isn't a variable once you've put the film in the camera).

The first thing I noticed was the 50mm lens was much wider than the 50mm on my DSLR. The Canon 500D has a crop sensor which means you lose about 60% of the frame. This makes it feel zoomed in compared to a full frame or film camera. I loved being able to get more in the frame at a natural focal length, it also meant I had to get much closer if I wanted to fill the frame.

I got my first roll of film developed by Ilford and was really happy with some of the results. After that I went on the course at Street Level and learned to develop the film myself and how to use an enlarger to make prints. Working in a darkroom is strangely relaxing, it's usually really quiet and the time just flies past.

I loved using this camera, unfortunately the shutter now tends to stick at lower shutter speeds, even after a service from a local repair shop.

Shooting film is considered a bit of a hipster thing to do now, but I really enjoy the process and I think understanding where photography came from can really help you appreciate where it is now.
