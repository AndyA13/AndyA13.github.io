Well we've kicked it into high gear now. We are in class from 9-5, study at the apartment until 7:30, go for dinner, then go back and study until about 9 or 10. I keep getting really tired in class which is annoying because I'm sure I'm getting enough sleep. Divakar had coffee today and it smelled so good, I'm not sure if I trust the coffee machine though.

Tonight I went through 95 test questions for the 70-515 exam. Took around 3 hours in total and I've got a list of stuff I want to look into before the exam. Good news is I got enough right that it would have been a pass (821/1000). That's a bit of a confidence booster because we have both felt totally overwhelmed the last few days.

I'm still a little worried about only having 2 days to study for the WCF exam. But we are hoping the WCF exam will be a lot more focused and easier to study for than the web development exam which covers such a vast amount.

### Other Happenings

We took a walk down 18th June Street the other day. There are lots of shops selling car batteries. We found the Bombay bazaar which seems to sell some nice things but the staff are constantly trying to show you things. Outside isn't much better, I got followed down the street by a woman trying to sell me cashmere pashminas. I must have told her "no" about ten times. They are pretty cheap but I don't know anyone who would want one. We got caught in the rain on the way back, it started off light but in about 5 minutes it was a torrential downpour. I did manage to run from Koenig back to the apartment without any anterior tibialis issues. It's been a while since I've been able to run that far.

Today on the way back to apartment there were two guys selling bed sheets on the street. As we passed he just looked at Gareth and said, "hello bedsheets," in a husky voice. We didn't know what to say to that.

I updated my photos on [Picasa](https://picasaweb.google.com/103470855459885510201/201106Goa?authuser=0&feat=directlink) yesterday, I don't expect there will be much more for me to post over the next two weeks.

Sorry if this post seems a bit broken, I think my brain has already gone to bed.
