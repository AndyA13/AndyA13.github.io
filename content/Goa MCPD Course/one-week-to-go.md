Last week went well. We went over the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) books and passed the 70-513 exam with 950/1000. To be honest the course was too fast and I think I'll be keeping the books for future reference. WCF is vast. There is so much in there and to cover it all in three days was just not enough to really get to grips with it.

I can't beleive it's been two weeks already. The time has really flown past. So far we have completed eight books, two exams and we are halfway through the two data access in .Net 4 books. Once we finish that we will have another exam, then we will sit the MCPD exam. I'm not sure if we get any books for the last one, as it is more of a summary of all the other modules we have studied so far.

So far the data modules have been quite straight forward and tomorrow we start a module about using entity framework in an n-tier environment which I'm quite interested in.

Not a lot else has been happening. We went out for a drink on Friday after passing the WCF exam. We studied a lot this week and haven't gotten out much so not a lot to report.
